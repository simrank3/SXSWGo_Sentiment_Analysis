## Problem

Twitter's CEO, Elon Musk, wants to add emojis, users can click, as responses to tweets. Currently there are no emojis available, only the option to "heart" a tweet. He wants to understand the overall sentiments of tweets users share, to determine which emojis would be best to add.

This analysis will use Natural Language Processing ("NLP") to understand overall tweet sentiment.

## Data

Data was taken from [data.world](https://data.world/crowdflower/brands-and-product-emotions). It contains over 9,000 different tweets with the device it was shared from as well as if there is a positive, negative or neutral emotion to the tweet.

## Next Steps

The final model yielded an accuracy if 68.8%, which is a number that can possibly be better. Some ideas to better performance are as follows:
* Running the analysis with a different population of tweets and narrowing down the number of neutral tweets in the population. 
* Factoring in major events that may be taking place. Tweets tend to focus on events and as seen above, the data was surrounded around SXSW. 
* Tagging an initial emotion to the tweet should be done by a few people. This will allow the tagged emotion to be more likely correct.
